This project developed analytical frameworks for automating cause of death classification from verbal autopsy, utilizing both the unstructured narratives and structured question responses. This project aimed to answer the following research questions: 

- **Q1**: How well do current state-of-the-art pre-trained language models (PLMs) perform
on VA narratives?
- **Q2**: How can structured and unstructured VA data be combined in multi-modal learning
frameworks for automated COD classification?
