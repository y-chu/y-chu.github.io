I'm a demographer and population health researcher, with multidisciplinary training and working experience in demography, population health, data science, computational social science, epidemiology, and clinical medicine. Yue received a M.B.B.S in China concentrating on public health and preventive medicine and then a Master in Public Health and worked as a research associate in Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Yue is now a Ph.D candidate at Department of Sociology and an affiliate of Institute for Population Research, Translational Data Analytics Institute, and alumni of Nationwide Center for Advanced Customer Insights. 


Research interest
======
My research mainly focuses on improving estimates and estimation methodologies of demographic and health statistics in low-and-middle-income countries, and global health inequalities. I’m also interested in facilitating the translation of research findings into evidence-based practices. 

Currently I’m applying statistical and demographic methods to various projects including: 1) leveraging machine learning and large language models to improve cause of death classification from verbal autopsies; 2) development of Bayesian model for indirect estimation of mortality and fertility for detailed age groups; 3) development of Reference Death Archive, a relational database for knowledge sharing in developing countries; 4) explore the association between cause of death and social determinants of health for children; 5) evaluating data quality in population surveys and demographic surveillance system.
