**Background**  
The absence of high-quality comprehensive civil registration and vital statistics systems across many settings in Africa has led to limited empirical data on causes of death in the region.

**Methods**  
We harmonized verbal autopsy (VA) and residency data from nine health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) sites across Eastern and Southern Africa, each with variable coverage across the period 1995-2019. InSilicoVA, a Bayesian probabilistic model, was used to assign cause of death based on the signs and symptoms reported in the VA. Levels and trends in all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates and cause-specific mortality fractions were calculated, stratified by HDSS site, sex, age, and calendar periods.

**Findings**  
All-cause mortality has generally decreased across the HDSS sites, particularly for adults aged 20-59. In many of the HDSS sites, these decreases were driven by reductions in HIV/TB-related deaths. For 2010-2014, the top causes of death were: road traffic accidents, HIV/TB and meningitis/sepsis for adolescents (12-19 years), HIV/TB for adults (20-59 years), and neoplasms and cardiovascular disease for older adults (>59 years). There was greater between-HDSS and between-sex variation in causes of death for adolescents compared to adults.

**Interpretation**  
This study shows that there has been progress in reducing mortality across Eastern and Southern Africa but also points to age, sex and between-HDSS differences in causes of adolescent and adult deaths. This highlights the importance of detailed local-level data to inform health needs to ensure continued improvements in survival.
